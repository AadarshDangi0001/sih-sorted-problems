        "description": "Background -The Government of India is implementing the Bharat Pashudhan App (BPA) for systematic data recording of breeding, health, and nutrition of dairy animals. Field Level Workers (FLWs) are responsible for capturing animal data on the ground. However, despite multiple training programs, a recurring issue is the incorrect identification and registration of animal breeds of cattle and buffaloes. This misclassification significantly affects the integrity and usability of the data for research, policy planning, and targeted interventions Description- Breed identification errors in BPA often arise due to manual judgment and lack of breed-specific awareness among FLWs. India, being home to a diverse array of indigenous and crossbred cattle and buffalo breeds, presents a complex challenge for accurate breed identification. Incorrect entries compromise the value of collected data and, in turn, impact the effectiveness of genetic improvement, nutrition planning, disease control, and overall program outcomes. To address this, an AI-driven solution that can identify the breed of an animal using its image can prove extremely valuable. By using image recognition and machine learning techniques, the software can standardize breed identification and minimize manual errors. If successfully developed and validated, such a system can be integrated with the BPA to act as a decision-support tool for FLWs during registration Expected Solution-• Uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and image analysis to recognize and classify the breed of cattle and buffaloes based on images.• Can handle diverse environmental backgrounds,lighting conditions, and varying animal poses.• Maintains a breed database (for the most common Indian cattle and buffalo breeds and their crosses).• Provides breed suggestions or confirmations at the time of registration in BPA.• Can be seamlessly integrated with the BPA platform to support real-time validation or correction of breed entries.• Includes a user-friendly interface for FLWs with minimal technical training requirements.",

        "description": "Background: In dairy farming, evaluating the body structure of animals is vital to predict their longevity, productivity, and reproductive efficiency. Traditionally, Animal Type Classification (ATC)—which involves scoring animals for physical traits—is conducted by trained personnel through visual inspection and manual measurement of specific body parts. However, this manual method is prone to human error and subjectivity, even with trained professionals, resulting in inconsistent and potentially unreliable data. With advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and image processing technologies, there is an opportunity to automate this process. Automated scoring based on images can ensure standardization, minimize observer bias, and improve the reliability of data captured for scientific and breeding purposes.Description: The Government of India is implementing the Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) since December 2014, aiming to conserve and develop indigenous bovine breeds, genetically upgrade the bovine population, and enhance milk productivity. Under this mission, Progeny Testing (PT) and Pedigree Selection (PS) programs are being carried out in key dairy breeds across the country to produce high genetic merit bulls for breeding purposes.Animal Type Classification (ATC) is a crucial step in identifying top-performing elite dams, which are potential mothers of future breeding bulls. Currently, ATC is performed manually by a trained Animal Typer who visually examines and measures physical traits, and then records the scores in the Bharat Pashudhan App (BPA). Despite training, errors due to fatigue, bias, or measurement inaccuracies can adversely affect data quality and scientific analysis.There is a need for an AI-driven solution that can automate this classification process by analyzing animal images, extracting body structure parameters, and assigning standardized scores with minimal human intervention. If integrated with BPA, such a solution would enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and scientific validity of animal evaluation under PT and PS programs.Expected Solution: Students are expected to develop an AI-based Auto Recording of Animal Type Classification System that can:Use images of cattle and buffaloes to evaluate physical traits relevant to Animal Type Classification.Extract and quantify specific body structure parameters (e.g., body length, height at withers, chest width, rump angle, etc.) using AI and image processing techniques.Generate objective and consistent classification scores.Auto-record and store the classification data in a structured format.Provide seamless integration with BPA to auto-save the classification records at the time of evaluation.Be user-friendly and operable by field personnel with minimal technical skills.",

Students are often taught textbook-based content with little emphasis on real-world application, local ecological issues, or personal responsibility.There is a lack of engaging tools that motivate students to adopt eco-friendly practices or understand the direct consequences of their lifestyle choices. Traditional methods fail to instill sustainable habits or inspire youth participation in local environmental efforts.Impact As future decision-makers, students must be environmentally literate and   empowered to take meaningful actions. Without innovative education methods, we risk raising a generation unaware of sustainability challenges.An interactive, practical approach to environmental learning will foster long-term behavioral change, local involvement, and a ripple effect across families and communities. This aligns with India's SDG goals and NEP 2020's emphasis on experiential learning.Expected Outcomes• A gamified mobile/web platform or app that teaches students about environmental issues through interactive lessons, challenges, quizzes, and real-world tasks (e.g., tree-planting, waste segregation).• Tracking of eco-points, enabling school-level competitions.• Rewards for sustainable practices through digital badges and recognition.Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries• School and college students• Teachers and eco-club coordinators• Environmental NGOs and government departments Supporting Data • UNESCO reports that experiential, gamified learning increases student retention and engagement by over 70%.• NEP 2020 encourages integration of environmental awareness into the curriculum.",
