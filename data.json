        "description": "Background -The Government of India is implementing the Bharat Pashudhan App (BPA) for systematic data recording of breeding, health, and nutrition of dairy animals. Field Level Workers (FLWs) are responsible for capturing animal data on the ground. However, despite multiple training programs, a recurring issue is the incorrect identification and registration of animal breeds of cattle and buffaloes. This misclassification significantly affects the integrity and usability of the data for research, policy planning, and targeted interventions Description- Breed identification errors in BPA often arise due to manual judgment and lack of breed-specific awareness among FLWs. India, being home to a diverse array of indigenous and crossbred cattle and buffalo breeds, presents a complex challenge for accurate breed identification. Incorrect entries compromise the value of collected data and, in turn, impact the effectiveness of genetic improvement, nutrition planning, disease control, and overall program outcomes. To address this, an AI-driven solution that can identify the breed of an animal using its image can prove extremely valuable. By using image recognition and machine learning techniques, the software can standardize breed identification and minimize manual errors. If successfully developed and validated, such a system can be integrated with the BPA to act as a decision-support tool for FLWs during registration Expected Solution-• Uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and image analysis to recognize and classify the breed of cattle and buffaloes based on images.• Can handle diverse environmental backgrounds,lighting conditions, and varying animal poses.• Maintains a breed database (for the most common Indian cattle and buffalo breeds and their crosses).• Provides breed suggestions or confirmations at the time of registration in BPA.• Can be seamlessly integrated with the BPA platform to support real-time validation or correction of breed entries.• Includes a user-friendly interface for FLWs with minimal technical training requirements.",
    "explanation": "This problem focuses on helping field workers correctly identify cattle and buffalo breeds in India. Currently, breed identification is done manually, which often leads to mistakes because of limited knowledge and judgment. These errors reduce the quality of data in the Bharat Pashudhan App, which is important for animal health, breeding, nutrition, and government planning. To solve this, an AI-based image recognition system can be used. By analyzing animal photos, the system can suggest or confirm the correct breed, even in different environments or lighting. This tool will reduce errors, improve data reliability, and make breed registration easier."

        "theme": "Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development",
        "description": "Background: In dairy farming, evaluating the body structure of animals is vital to predict their longevity, productivity, and reproductive efficiency. Traditionally, Animal Type Classification (ATC)—which involves scoring animals for physical traits—is conducted by trained personnel through visual inspection and manual measurement of specific body parts. However, this manual method is prone to human error and subjectivity, even with trained professionals, resulting in inconsistent and potentially unreliable data. With advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and image processing technologies, there is an opportunity to automate this process. Automated scoring based on images can ensure standardization, minimize observer bias, and improve the reliability of data captured for scientific and breeding purposes.Description: The Government of India is implementing the Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) since December 2014, aiming to conserve and develop indigenous bovine breeds, genetically upgrade the bovine population, and enhance milk productivity. Under this mission, Progeny Testing (PT) and Pedigree Selection (PS) programs are being carried out in key dairy breeds across the country to produce high genetic merit bulls for breeding purposes.Animal Type Classification (ATC) is a crucial step in identifying top-performing elite dams, which are potential mothers of future breeding bulls. Currently, ATC is performed manually by a trained Animal Typer who visually examines and measures physical traits, and then records the scores in the Bharat Pashudhan App (BPA). Despite training, errors due to fatigue, bias, or measurement inaccuracies can adversely affect data quality and scientific analysis.There is a need for an AI-driven solution that can automate this classification process by analyzing animal images, extracting body structure parameters, and assigning standardized scores with minimal human intervention. If integrated with BPA, such a solution would enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and scientific validity of animal evaluation under PT and PS programs.Expected Solution: Students are expected to develop an AI-based Auto Recording of Animal Type Classification System that can:Use images of cattle and buffaloes to evaluate physical traits relevant to Animal Type Classification.Extract and quantify specific body structure parameters (e.g., body length, height at withers, chest width, rump angle, etc.) using AI and image processing techniques.Generate objective and consistent classification scores.Auto-record and store the classification data in a structured format.Provide seamless integration with BPA to auto-save the classification records at the time of evaluation.Be user-friendly and operable by field personnel with minimal technical skills.",
    "explanation": "This problem focuses on automating Animal Type Classification (ATC) for cattle and buffaloes. Currently, ATC is done manually by trained professionals who visually inspect and measure physical traits of animals. However, this method is prone to human error, bias, and inconsistencies, which can reduce data accuracy. Since ATC plays a key role in selecting top-performing animals for breeding under the Rashtriya Gokul Mission, reliable evaluation is very important. An AI-based solution can use images to automatically analyze body structure traits, generate consistent scores, and directly record data in the Bharat Pashudhan App. This will improve accuracy, save time, and standardize evaluations."

        "theme": "Clean & Green Technology",
        "description": "Background In FY 2021–22, India generated approximately 1.7 lakh tonnes of municipal solid waste daily, of which only 54% was scientifically treated. Around 24% was dumped in landfills and 22% remained unaccounted due to leakages in the waste management chain. This unaccounted waste is often burned or disposed of in open areas, drains, or water bodies, posing severe environmental and public health risks. (CEEW, 2025) This calls for strict solutions to enable all the waste generators to contribute to Waste Management. Description Overview: According to the CPCB’s Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Annual Report for 2021-22, India generates approximately 1,70,339 tonnes of waste per day (TPD). Of this, around 1,56,449 TPD is collected. Out of the collected waste, 91,511 TPD is treated, while 41,455 TPD is disposed of in landfills. This leaves a significant gap of 37,373 TPD in effective waste management. Waste treatment: The total waste processed/treated across the country is 91,511 TPD. When compared to the total waste generated, which is 1,70,339 TPD, it is found that an average of 54% of the waste is treated/processed across the country.Solid Waste Processing Facilities: A total of 249 Waste-to-Energy plants, 819 Biomass Power plants and 50.8 lakhs small Biogas plants have been set up in the country to generate Power/Biogas/BioCNG.Expected Solutions The proposals aim to develop a strict system to ensure that every citizen is trained on waste management, waste workers get strict training and required safety gear, waste management facilities are present in every ULB/GP, and a dedicated decentralised monitoring system is in place. The solutions are as follows: 1. Mandatory training for every citizen: Similar to countries where military training is mandatory for every citizen, in India, there shall be mandatory Waste Management training for every Waste Generator/Citizen. This will ensure source segregation, which will result in better waste management, lesser load on waste management facilities and landfills. i. Physical training on types of waste, source segregation, how to make compost at home, re-use of plastic, etc. ii. Distribution of 3 types of dustbins for dry, wet and domestic hazardous waste to every household/citizen.iii. Distribution of a designed and tested compost making kit to every household/citizen. iv. App-based monitoring. 2. Phase-wise training to all Waste Workers3. Formation of Area Committee for Monitoring – to be called as “Green Champions”: Decentralised approach for Monitoring has to be done at every step of Waste Management for bulk waste generators, residential areas, commercial & Public semi-public building, Industrial buildings, etc.i. Training of all Waste Generators ii. Waste Generation: Source segregation happening or not, no wet waste to be collected iii. Waste Collection happening on ground leveliv. Waste transportationv. Waste treatmentvi. Waste Disposal 4. Incentive based approach: Incentive to Bulk waste generators and other buildings for source segregation.5. Waste Movements in ULBs: Taking example from Karnataka’s Yadgir city, “If you see waste, send photo” similar movement to be made mandatory for every ULB regardless of its size and population, to ensure community participation. 6. Community Participation: One day of all working staff regardless of employment type to be engaged in Cleaning of Public areas, waste management. Inspired from Cleaning-day followed in schools every week, every waste generator to be responsible for keeping the country clean and contributing to waste management, starting from Govt. sector.7.

        "theme": "Smart Education",
        "description": "Background: Despite increasing digitization in education, student achievements ranging from academic excellence to participation in curricular and extracurricular activities remain scattered across various departments or lost in paper-based records, in many colleges and universities. There is no centralized digital platform that enables institutions to document, track, and showcase a student's complete profile, including:- Conferences and workshops attended- Certifications earned- Club activities and volunteering efforts- Competitions and academic contests- Leadership roles and internships - Community services done This gap not only hampers institutional efficiency but also limits students' ability to build a verified and dynamic portfolio that could support job applications, higher education admissions, and skill recognition. In addition, during events like NAAC accreditation, the lack of consolidated data becomes a major administrative challenge.Description:The above problem necessitates the development of a Smart Student Hub (Mobile + Web Application) that acts as a centralized student record and achievement management platform. Key Features include: - Dynamic Student Dashboard: Real-time updates on academic performance, attendance, and credit-based activities. - Activity Tracker: Upload and validate participation in seminars, conferences, online courses (e.g., MOOCs), internships, and extra-curriculars. - Faculty Approval Panel: Faculty or admin can approve uploaded records to maintain credibility.- Auto-Generated Digital Portfolio: Downloadable and shareable verified student portfolio in PDF or web link format.- Analytics & Reporting: For institutions to generate reports for NAAC, AICTE, NIRF, or internal evaluations.- Integration Support: Can link with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS), ERP, or digital university platforms.Impact and Benefits:- Empowers students with a verified, holistic digital profile.- Facilitates career planning, placements, and scholarship/higher studies applications.- Reduces administrative burden during audits and accreditations.- Encourages participation in co-curricular activities by making achievements visible and valued.- Promotes data-driven decision-making at the institutional level.Expected Solution:We propose the development of a mobile + web-based application that can digitally catalogue and manage a student's academic and non-academic achievements throughout their time in college. The proposed protocol will:- Build a verified, holistic student profile from Day 1- Reduce paperwork and improve transparency- Make students better prepared for placements, fellowships, or postgraduate admissions- Empower faculty with real-time data for mentoring and tracking- Align with the digital transformation goals of higher education institutions- Enhance institutional efficiency during accreditation or policy audits This will bridge the gap by offering an all-in-one solution that empowers students, simplifies faculty tasks, and modernizes institutional operations.",
    "explanation": "This project is about building a centralized digital system to record all student activities in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Instead of only keeping academic marks, the platform will also track extracurricular activities, internships, projects, sports achievements, and volunteer work. Students will have a single digital profile showing their all-round growth. Teachers and universities can use this record for performance evaluation, scholarships, or placements. It makes student data easy to access, transparent, and verifiable. This system supports holistic education by recognizing skills beyond academics, making students more employable and giving them a well-rounded portfolio for their future careers."

        "title": "One-Stop Personalized Career & Education Advisor",
        "theme": "Smart Education",
        "description": "Background The decline in student enrollment in government degree colleges is not a consequence of poor infrastructure or lack of teaching resources. At the heart of the problem lies a critical gap in awareness, most students and often their parents do not understand the importance of graduation, what career opportunities different degree courses unlock, or how to choose a subject stream based on personal interest and future prospects. After passing Class 10 or 12, students face confusion about: - Which subject stream (Arts, Science, Commerce) to opt for. - What kind of degree programs are available in nearby government colleges.- What jobs or higher studies they can pursue after choosing a particular course.- Whether pursuing graduation is even worth the effort, especially when short-term job or skill-based courses seem more accessible. This lack of clarity leads to poor academic decisions, dropouts, or migration to private institutions that often promise but fail to deliver quality education. Description The above problem statement envisages that a customized Digital Guidance Platform for students should be developed as a one-stop personalized career and education advisor.Key Features of the App/Web Platform:- Aptitude & Interest-Based Course Suggestion: Short quizzes to assess the student's interests, strengths and personality traits. Based on results, the app will suggest suitable streams and subjects (Arts, Science, Commerce, Vocational). Students can compare career paths based on different combinations.- Course-to-Career Path Mapping: Detailed visual charts showing what each degree (B.A., B.Sc., B.Com., BBA, etc.) offers. The industries or sectors each course leads to and relevant government exams, private jobs, entrepreneurial options, or higher education available after each stream.- Nearby Government Colleges Directory: Location-based listing of government colleges, information on available degree programs; cut-offs and eligibility, medium of instruction, facilities (hostel, lab, library, internet access).- Timeline Tracker: Notification system for admission dates, scholarship application windows, college entrance tests or counseling schedules.- Customization and Personalization: User profiles created at login — tracking age, gender, class, academic interests. AI-driven recommendation engine suggests:• Courses to apply for.• Colleges nearby.• Career paths aligned with their aptitude.• Study materials tailored to subject choice.",
    "explanation": "This project is about creating a digital advisor that helps students plan their education and career paths. Using AI, the platform will analyze students’ strengths, interests, skills, and academic performance to suggest the best career options, courses, and training programs. It will also provide information on scholarships, entrance exams, and job opportunities. Students can get personalized guidance just like a career counselor, but available online 24/7. This system ensures that students, especially from rural or underprivileged areas, receive equal access to career advice. By offering customized roadmaps, it helps youth make informed choices and achieve long-term success."

        "title": "Remote classroom for rural colleges",
        "theme": "Smart Education",
        "description": "Background: Rural diploma colleges often operate without subject Lecturers in various fields such as artificial intelligence, VLSI, or renewable energy. Students must rely on self-study material or travel to cities for coaching,deepening the urban-rural learning divide. Description: The challenge is less about willingness than about infrastructure. Typical village campuses juggle low and unstable data speeds, making conventional video-conferencing unreliable. Previous interventions failed when platforms assumed high-bandwidth links or required complicated equipment. To succeed, a new approach must embrace low-bandwidth realities, prioritise audio quality, compress visual content, and ensure that learning can continue even during connectivity lapses. It should encourage synchronous interaction yet also provide recordings that remain small enough for easy download on limited data plans. Faculty in cities need a simple way to deliver lectures from any quiet corner, while rural students require a user experience that functions on entry-level smartphones. Interactive elements quizzes, polls, discussion boards-must remain functional at low speeds.Crucially, the entire solution should minimise the leaming curve for educators and be financially sustainable for resource-constrained institutes. By offering a design that blends live engagement with asynchronous access, the college can bring expert instruction to every campus without waiting for large capital investments.This is precisely the sort of context-aware challenge that Smart India Hackathon teams can address through innovative but lightweight software solutions. Expected Solution: Student teams should outline a software-only virtual-classroom ecosystem that delivers clear audio and concise visual content on limited bandwidth, supports interactive live as well as recorded sessions, and allows easy content access for learners who may need to download materials during off-peak hours-all without relying on specialised hardware or costly licences.",
    "explanation": "This project focuses on building a remote classroom system to provide quality education in rural colleges. Using online platforms, virtual lectures, and digital tools, students in rural areas can access the same learning resources as urban students. Teachers from anywhere can deliver live or recorded classes, and students can interact through video conferencing, quizzes, and discussions. The system reduces the lack of faculty in remote regions and ensures better learning opportunities. It bridges the education gap, supports the National Education Policy’s goals, and helps students from rural backgrounds gain knowledge, confidence, and skills needed for future careers."

        "theme": "Smart Automation",
        "description": "Background: By the time term-end marks reveal failures, many struggling students have disengaged beyond recovery. Counsellors and mentors need a mechanism that surfaces risk indicators-faliing attendance, high number of attempts exhausted to pass a particular subject, reducing test scores-weeks earlier. Description: Attendance percentages live in one spreadsheet, test results in another, and fee-payment data in a third. No single view exists to signal that a learner is slipping in multiple areas simultaneously. Commercial analytics platforms promise predictive insights but demand funds and maintenance beyond the reach of public institutes. A simpler, transparent approach would merge existing spreadsheets,apply clear logic to colour-code risk,and notify mentors on a predictable schedule.Such a system must be easy to configure, require minimal training, and empower educators-not replace their judgment. By focusing on data fusion and timely alerts rather than complex algorithms, the institute can intervene early and reduce drop-out rates without fresh budget lines.This challenge epitomises the hackathon spirit: take what is already present, integrate it cleverly, and produce meaningful impact using machine learning. Expected SoIution: Participants are expected to build a consolidated digitaI dashboard that automatically ingests attendance,assessment scores, and other student related dala;applies clear, rule-based thresholds to identify at-risk students; highIights them in an intuitive visual format; and dispatches regular notifications to mentors and guardians, ensuring early,data-driven intervention achieved entirely through suitable machine learning approaches.",
    "explanation": "This project is about using AI to predict which students are at risk of dropping out of school or college. The system will analyze data like attendance, grades, financial background, and engagement levels to identify struggling students. Once identified, it will alert teachers and provide counseling support to help those students. The platform may suggest mentorship programs, financial aid, or personalized study plans to keep students motivated. By intervening early, the system can reduce dropout rates, ensure continuity in education, and improve student success rates. It helps institutions support vulnerable students and promote equal access to education for all."

        "theme": "Smart Automation",
        "description": "Background: Admissions, fee collection, hostel allocation, and examination records are maintained in separate ledgers. Students queue at multiple counters; staff re-enter identical data; and administrators lack a real-time institutional overview. Description: Comprehensive ERP suites can unify data but remain out of financial reach for many public colleges. Yet much of the required functionality-customised online forms, central data tables, automated receipts, real-time dashboards-already exists in ubiquitous cloud office suites. By intelligently connecting these services, an institution can create a single source of truth without large capital outlay. Essential components include streamlined admission intake, automated fee receipting, live hostel occupancy tracking, and summary dashboards for higher officials. Data security, role-based access and regular back-ups must be baked in from day one. Because staff is already familiar with basic spreadsheet and form tools, the learning curve remains shallow, ensuring broad adoption. Hackathon participants can demonstrate how thoughtful process mapping and lightweight scripting turn an assortment of familiar apps into a cohesive, low-cost ERP that any college can replicate. Expected Solution: Teams should outline an integrated workflow in which admission data flows seamlessly into a central student database, financial transactions automatically generate digital receipts, hostel and library records update the same database in real time, and summary dashboards present key metrics to administrators all delivered through interlinked, widely available software services rather than proprietary or hardware-intensive solutions.",
    "explanation": "This project is about creating a centralized ERP-based platform to manage student-related activities in schools and colleges. The system will cover admissions, attendance, timetable scheduling, exams, results, fees, and hostel management in one place. Being language-agnostic means it will support multiple Indian languages, making it accessible across regions. Teachers, students, and parents can access data easily, improving transparency and efficiency. It reduces paperwork, saves time, and ensures smooth coordination between departments. By digitizing student management, this system makes education administration more organized and reliable, creating a seamless experience for institutions, students, and parents alike across different states."

        "theme": "Smart Education",
        "description": "Background: Campus offices answer hundreds of repetitive queries-fee deadlines, scholarship forms, timetable changes often from students more comfortable in Hindi or other regional languages. Long queues and communication gaps strain both staff and learners.. Description: While answers reside in circulars and PDFs, students prefer conversational guidance. A multilingual chatbot that understands Hindi, English, and an additional local language can deflect routine inquiries, freeing staff for complex tasks. Modern conversational-Al services offer drag-and-drop interfaces. Key requirements include accurate intent recognition, context management across multiple turns, fallback to human contact when necessary, and daily conversation logs for continuous improvement. Embedding the chatbot on the college website and popular messaging platforms maximises reach. Crucially, the solution must respect privacy, ensure response accuracy, and remain maintainable by student volunteers after the hackathon concludes. By focusing on content curation and user-centric design, participants can deliver high impact solution quickly. Expected Solution: Student innovators should develop a multilingual conversational assistant that ingests institutional FAQs, recognises and responds to student queries in at least five regional languages, maintains context across follow-up questions, logs interactions for review, and integrates seamlessly into the college's existing web and messaging channels-achieving equitable, round-the-clock information access in a user friendly manner.",
    "explanation": "This project aims to create a chatbot for education that can answer students’ questions instantly. Whether it’s about syllabus, exams, results, or assignments, students can interact with the chatbot 24/7 on their mobile or computer. Teachers can also use it to share updates and reminders. The chatbot will use AI and natural language processing to give accurate and quick responses in simple language. It saves time for both students and teachers by automating routine queries. This solution makes communication faster, improves student support, and ensures everyone has easy access to important academic information anytime they need it."
